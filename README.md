# Backend roadmap.sh

This repository represents my journey through the backend roadmap projects from [roadmap.sh/backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend).  
The projects are designed to help developers like myself build practical skills and create a strong portfolio while following industry best practices.

## Projects Distribution
- **11 Beginner Projects (Projects 1‚Äì11):** Focusing on fundamental concepts and basic implementations.
- **7 Intermediate Projects (Projects 12‚Äì18):** Building upon foundational skills with more complex scenarios.
- **4 Advanced Projects (Projects 19‚Äì22):** Challenging experienced developers with sophisticated system design.
