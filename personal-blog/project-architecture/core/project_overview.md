### Development Principles
1. **Constructor Injection**: Always prefer constructor injection over field injection
2. **Immutable DTOs**: Use Java records for data transfer objects
3. **Exception Safety**: Comprehensive error handling with global exception management
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
5. **Security First**: Validate all inputs and secure all endpoints

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Architecture Design**: Plan component interactions and data flow
3. **Test Planning**: Define test scenarios and acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation**: Write clean, documented, and tested code
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify component interactions
6. **Security Review**: Validate security implications
7. **Performance Testing**: Ensure scalability requirements
8. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Quality Assurance Standards
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 95% for service layer, 80% overall
- **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical endpoints
- **Code Review**: Peer review for all changes
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation current

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
