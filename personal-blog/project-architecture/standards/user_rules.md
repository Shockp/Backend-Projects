# Personal Development Rules for AI Collaboration

## Communication Preferences

### Language & Tone
- Communicate in English with technical precision
- Provide detailed explanations for complex concepts
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Break down large tasks into manageable steps
- Always include reasoning behind technical decisions

### Response Format
- Structure responses with clear headings and sections
- Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Include practical examples alongside theoretical explanations
- Provide both implementation and testing approaches
- Reference official documentation when applicable

## Development Philosophy

### Code Quality Standards
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Always include unit tests for new functionality
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns where appropriate

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Analyze requirements thoroughly before implementing
- Consider security implications for every feature
- Think about scalability and performance from the start
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Plan for testing and debugging from the beginning

## Technical Preferences

### Java Development
- Use modern Java features (21+) when appropriate
- Prefer immutable objects and functional programming concepts
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exceptions
- Use dependency injection and IoC container patterns
- Apply logging best practices with structured logging

### Spring Boot Ecosystem
- Leverage Spring Boot auto-configuration capabilities
- Use Spring profiles for environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper transaction management
- Apply Spring Security best practices
- Utilize Spring Data JPA for data access patterns

### Database Design
- Design normalized database schemas
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use database constraints for data integrity
- Plan for data migration and versioning
- Consider query performance optimization

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Analysis**: Understand requirements and edge cases
2. **Design**: Plan architecture and data flow
3. **Implementation**: Write clean, tested code
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Review**: Consider security and performance implications

### Code Review Mindset
- Focus on functionality, readability, and maintainability
- Check for security vulnerabilities and performance issues
- Verify proper error handling and edge case coverage
- Ensure adequate test coverage and documentation
- Validate adherence to coding standards and best practices

## Security Consciousness

### Security-First Approach
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Never log sensitive information
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Consider OWASP security guidelines

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS)
- Apply appropriate access controls
- Plan for audit logging and monitoring

## Learning & Improvement
